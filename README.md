**MTKPI** – Multi Tool Kubernetes Pentest Image. This docker image contains all the most popular and necessary tools for Kubernetes penetration testing. Everything you need at your fingertips.

*Image was generated by [Kandinsky 2.2](https://www.sberbank.com/promo/kandinsky/)*

## Motivation
When you're pentesting a Kubernetes cluster, you'll certainly use automated tools to perform the checks. But what if your cluster is network-limited and you can't download the tools you need inside the Pod? Or a read-only container file system? In this case, the only solution is to use a ready-to-use image, inside of which there are all the tools you need. This image includes all possible popular tools for pentesting a Kubernetes cluster, including those with automatic checks.

## Threat Matrix for Kubernetes
![Logo](images/matrix.png)
MTKPI covers most of the techniques described in Microsoft Threat Matrix for Kubernetes. This in turn provides a wide range of pentesting possibilities. If necessary, you can add the necessary tools to the image and increase the coverage of the matrix.

## What's inside?
### Shell via web
Often, when pentesting Kubernetes Cluster, you have a developer Service Account with limited permissions. In other words, you don't have sufficient permissions to run `pods/exec`, which means you just can't get inside the container. However, it's more common for developers to have rights to create `port-forward`. This is why I used [ttyd](https://github.com/tsl0922/ttyd) as the base image ― it is a simple command-line tool for sharing terminals over the web.
### Tools
For convenience, I also have made a list of all possible tools that can be useful when pentesting Kubernetes and packed it in an image:

- [botb](https://github.com/brompwnie/botb)
- [kubeletctl](https://github.com/cyberark/kubeletctl)
- [kubesploit agent](https://github.com/cyberark/kubesploit)
- [CDK](https://github.com/cdk-team/CDK)
- [peirates](https://github.com/inguardians/peirates)
- [traitor](https://github.com/liamg/traitor)
- [ctrsploit](https://github.com/ctrsploit/ctrsploit)
- [kdigger](https://github.com/quarkslab/kdigger)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/)
- [linuxprivchecker](https://github.com/sleventyeleven/linuxprivchecker)
- [deepce](https://github.com/stealthcopter/deepce)
- [helm](https://helm.sh)
- [kube-hunter](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-hunter)
- [kube-bench](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench)
- [DDexec](https://github.com/carlospolop/DDexec)
- [kubetcd](https://github.com/nccgroup/kubetcd)

### Bypass signature engine
Sometimes, runtime security tools are found in Kubernetes clusters that work on a signature-based approach. Security tools like Falco and Tracee are quite easy to bypass, as their behavior is predefined by rules and signatures. There are quite a few ways to do this, one of the simplest being to rename executables. This is the method used in MTKPI.

For example:

- `kubectl` → `k`
- `python3` → `pton3`
- `curl` → `kurl`
- `wget` → `vget`

You can read more about the ways to bypass Falco [here](https://github.com/blackberry/Falco-bypasses).

## Usage

For fast deployment, run the following command:
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dab-solutions/MTKPI/main/deploy/mtkpi.yaml
```

It will create the pod and the service for you. Alternatively, you can manually run the followings:

Pod:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mtkpi-pod
  labels:
    app: mtkpi
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mtkpi-pod
    image: dabsolutions/mtkpi:v1.3
    ports:
    - containerPort: 7681
    securityContext:
      readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
```
Service:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mtkpi-svc
  labels:
    app: mtkpi
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
  - port: 7681
    protocol: TCP
  selector:
    app: mtkpi
```

To access the container, just run the command:

```bash
kubectl port-forward mtkpi-pod 7681:7681
```

Open in your browser:

```
localhost:7681
```
